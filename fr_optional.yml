#  WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT COMPLETE RIGHT NOW
# Install additional / optional components of the ForgeRock stack 
#  Put policy agents, web servers, etc. here
# Before this is run it is assumed some basic pre-reqs have been completed 
#
# - The forgerock user has been created (default to fr). The software is installed using this account
#  The "fr" user must be created with sudo priv. The vagrant.yml does this for you
# - Appropriate Firewall ports must be open on the guest. We use haproxy to put most things through 80/443
# Right now this is very much dependent on Fedora/Centos packages, etc.  There is a start at making it 
# Work on other platforms - but it needs work

# Tasks to complete with sudo privs

  sudo: yes
